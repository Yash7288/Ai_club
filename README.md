AI Club Task – Deep Learning Model Project
Overview
This project was developed as part of an AI Club task focused on building, training, and deploying a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
The workflow covers:
Data preprocessing
Model architecture design
Training and validation
Saving best model weights
Final model export
Inference using a prediction script
