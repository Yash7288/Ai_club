The following are the details of the task I did for AI club recruitments round 2.
MODEL PERFORMANCE(after 30 epochs): accuracy: 0.5553 - loss: 1.1270 - val_accuracy: 0.5718 - val_loss: 1.3181
Macro F1-score: 0.5514139524140744
dataset = RAVDESS
sampling_rate = 22050
train / val / test = 80 / 10 / 10
random_state = 42
stratified split = True
optimizer = Adam
loss = categorical_crossentropy
batch_size = 32
epochs = 30
callbacks = ModelCheckpoint (val_loss)

Due to some reasons i could not see the code after I uploaded the code in .ipynb format so I also uploaded it as python script
